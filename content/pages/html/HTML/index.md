<h4>What is HTML & CSS?</h4>
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structure of the page, this includes adding tagged text files, graphic images and hyperlinks. CSS is the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the text style, size, positioning, color, and more on a website. It's also what controls how a website's style shifts between desktop and mobile versions
