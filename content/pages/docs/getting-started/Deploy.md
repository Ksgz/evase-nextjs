<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h4>Static Site Generators:</h4>
Site generators are designed to automatically create and deploy with a single click of the button. You can choose the type of static websites you wish to generate. For these sites to generate we will use platforms such as Vercel & Netlify. Additional addons such as a headless CMS is provided for Netlify but not vercel. Vercel dedicates to static single pages for fast cache and prerendering like Netlify. To create a project and new repo, Netlify & Vercel both use Github. 

<h3>Using templates</h3>
Using free or paid templates can be incorperated into you're existing or new project. To learn how to add a template is quite simple!
